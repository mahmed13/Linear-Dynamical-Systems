# Linear-Dynamical-Systems
Basic implementation of a LDS to model some example dynamic textures.

# Optional Command Line Arguments
1. -f: a file path to a NumPy array file (the dynamic texture)
2. -q: an integer number of dimensions for the state-space
3. -o: a file path to an output file, where the prediction will be written
